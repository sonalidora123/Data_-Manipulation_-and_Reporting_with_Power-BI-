# Data_-Manipulation_-and_Reporting_with_Power-BI

### Project Overview

The aim is to construct a consolidated and interactive PowerBI report that will allow Zomato to quickly assess the required data.

### Data Cleaning/Data Preparation

1. Import the data from all available Excel files

2. Data transformation: 

- Make sure the City column names are corrected

  For example: 

  “Sí£o Paulo” should be corrected to “São Paulo”

- Ensure the city name isn't ambiguous
  For example: 

  “Cedar Rapids/Iowa City” should be corrected to “Cedar Rapids”

  “ÛÁstanbul” should be corrected to “Istanbul”

3. Remove any columns that aren't being used 

4. Create two columns to display the Restaurant Name and Restaurant Address

5. Make a separate table for the list of the cuisines that each restaurant serves

6. As it's a dimension table, the Country-Code table must only include unique and non-blank values

### Data Analysis Expressions(DAX)

1) Add a Rating color column in an appropriate table with the data rows in the format given below

 

2) Create the following measures in the appropriate tables 

    a. Restaurant count

    b. Average cost

    c. Average rating 

    d. Cuisine count

3) Create a new column in the Country Code table and name it “Continent” and create the values using the below-mentioned convention

Note: The mapping is continent - country, for example ''Africa – South Africa''
